use pos_app as middle man for financial_app and inventory_app
pos_app will have models representing a transaction sending financial data to the financial_app and updating inventory based on sale_items

name urls so that we can call reverse if needed:
    need to update:
        main url 
        my_site.url

each app will have a home page with a breakdown of the information they hold 
    will have pointers to more detailed information
